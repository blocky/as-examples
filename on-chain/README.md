# Project setup

You should not do this again, but here are the steps documenting the
process.

```bash
npm install npm@10.9.0
npm init
npm install --save-dev hardhat
npx hardhat init
```

The last step may hang, you can cancel and reissue the command

```bash
npm install --save-dev "@nomicfoundation/hardhat-toolbox@^5.0.0" --dd
```

Install other dependencies


```bash
npm install --save-dev -dd solidity-bytes-utils
```

You are ready to start going!!
